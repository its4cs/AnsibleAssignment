Topic: Continuous integration and Continuous Deployment using Jenkins and Ansible
The Assignment

All needs to be done using ansible modules with jenkins There will be three jenkins jobs, Provisioning, Build, Deployment.

Provisioning:-

    Provision application servers, for example - java, tomcat are required for a java project.
    This job will be a separate job and can be executed to any machine on requirement.

Build and Deployment Job will be in downstream relationship.

Build:-

    Build any Project - can be java or any other language using jenkins.

Deployment:-

    Create a down stream deployment job to the build job .
    In the deployment job , deploy the artifact (war in case of java) to the application server (tomcat/joboss) using ansible in the downstream job.
    Ansible play book will include health check also, (status code == 200) , if health check fails, job should also fail.
